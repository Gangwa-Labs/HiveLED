# HiveLed
An emulation of the nanoleaf hexagon tiles because I love how modular the design is but I couldn't find anything on it so I'm making my own.

This project will include almost all files and code as I fully believe in open sourcing the world. Anyway the files you can expect to see are
# CAD
# MicroController Code
[NodeMCU hive Mother](hex_controllerTest.ino)
# Pi Server Code
# My Music Playlist Cause Why Not
